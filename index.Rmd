I am a student at UT Austin, studying Statistics and Data Science. I enjoy cooking,
woodworking, and hiking in my free time. This is a website created for
SDS375 - Data Product Development.



Here is an list of three websites:

* [WindowSwap](https://www.window-swap.com/) - "Watch Windows Around The World"

* [EXP TV](https://exptv.org/) - "EXP TV is a live tv channel broadcasting an endless stream of obscure media and video ephemera."

* [BirdCast](https://birdcast.info/) - "Bird migration forecasts in real-time"
